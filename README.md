An Odin Project exercise to create a webpage with 16 x 16 grid of square divs with hover effect using only JavaScript.
This example showcases how all of the work can be performed using JavaScript and manipulating the DOM for CSS styling and adding HTML elements. Only initial DIVs and ID tags were created with HTML. The rest of the project could be performed within the console of the browser to render the full application.
